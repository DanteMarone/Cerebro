# Response to Tools Issue #4

Users reported difficulty managing tools and the inability to undo changes when enabling or disabling them. The following UI improvements are proposed to address this feedback:

- **Toggle Switches** – Each tool should have a clear on/off switch instead of a simple checkbox. This makes it obvious whether the tool is active.
- **Configure Button** – Tools that expose options will include a **Configure** button to open a settings dialog.
- **Revert Option** – When adjusting a tool's configuration, a **Revert to Default** or **Cancel Changes** action allows users to discard modifications easily. An explicit undo for enable/disable is less critical because toggling the switch again is straightforward.

These changes aim to make tool management more intuitive and forgiving.
