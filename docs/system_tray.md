# System Tray Icon

Cerebro provides a system tray icon for quick access to common actions, even when the main application window is minimized or closed to the tray. Right-clicking the Cerebro icon in your system tray will open a menu with the following options:

- **Open Cerebro:** Shows the main application window if it's hidden or minimized.
- **New Task:** Opens the "New Task" dialog directly, allowing you to quickly schedule a task for an agent.
- **Toggle Dark/Light Mode:** Switches the application's theme between dark and light modes.
- **Pause Notifications / Resume Notifications:** Toggles the display of toast notifications from the application. When paused, notifications are suppressed until resumed.
- **Start Screenshot Capture / Stop Screenshot Capture:** Toggles the automatic capturing of desktop screenshots for agents that have the "Desktop History Enabled" feature active.
- **Quit:** Exits the Cerebro application.

The system tray icon ensures that Cerebro can run in the background and still provide convenient access to its functionalities.
