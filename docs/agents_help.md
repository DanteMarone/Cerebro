# Agents Help

This guide explains each option in the Agents tab and provides quick links to related documentation. Access it from the "?" buttons in the Agents tab or from the Docs tab.

## Basic Settings

- **Model** – the Ollama model used for this agent.
- **Temperature** – controls randomness of responses.
- **Max Tokens** – maximum tokens in each response.
- **Custom System Prompt** – instructions prefixed to every conversation.

## Roles

Different agent roles determine how they interact with the system:

- **Assistant** – standard chat assistant.
- **Coordinator** – delegates work to other agents.
- **Specialist** – performs focused tasks.

See [Application Tabs – Agents](app_tabs.md#agents-tab) for more detail.

## Tools and Automations

Enable tool use so the agent can call scripts or automation sequences. You can select which tools and automations are available from the lists.

For additional details see [Plugins and Tools](plugins.md) and [Application Tabs – Automations](app_tabs.md#automations-tab).

## Thinking Mode

When enabled, the agent generates one or more "thought" messages before producing the final answer. Increase the number of steps to allow deeper reasoning.

## Text-to-Speech

Speak agent replies aloud using any voice installed on your system.
