# Cerebro User Guide

Cerebro is a cross‚Äêplatform desktop application for chatting with multiple AI agents powered by the
Ollama API. Each agent has a configurable role and capabilities. This document explains how to install
Cerebro and describes every tab and feature so you can quickly become productive.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and change into the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dantemarone/cerebro.git
   cd cerebro
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   # Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. (Optional) Use the helper script to install Ollama and download a model:
   ```bash
   python local_llm_helper.py install
   python local_llm_helper.py download llama3
   ```
5. Start the Ollama server separately and then run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Set the environment variable `DEBUG_MODE=1` to enable verbose logging.

To create a Windows installer, install PyInstaller and run `build_windows_installer.bat`. The resulting executable will appear in the `dist` directory.

## Application Overview

The main window is divided into several tabs. Use the numbered shortcuts `Ctrl+1` ‚Äì `Ctrl+6` to switch
between them.

## Chat Tab

The Chat tab is the primary interface for interacting with your agents.
- Enter a prompt at the bottom and press **Send**.
- Messages appear in a scrollable pane. While an agent is generating a reply, a "typing" indicator is
  shown.
- Use the menu in the upper‚Äëright corner to copy, save, export or clear the conversation history. Each
  session starts with a clean slate.
- Use the üîç button to search the current conversation.
- When many messages accumulate they are automatically summarized so prompts remain short.

Agents with *desktop history* enabled attach recent screenshots at a configurable interval. This helps
provide visual context for desktop‚Äëbased tasks.

## Agents Tab

The Agents tab allows you to create, edit and delete AI agents. Each agent stores the following
settings:

- **Model** ‚Äì select an installed Ollama model such as `llava` or `llama3.2-vision`.
- **Temperature** ‚Äì controls randomness of responses.
- **Max Tokens** ‚Äì maximum length of a single reply.
- **Custom System Prompt** ‚Äì additional instructions sent before every conversation.
- **Enabled** ‚Äì toggle to activate or disable the agent.
- **Role** ‚Äì choose between *Assistant*, *Coordinator* or *Specialist*.
- **Description** ‚Äì short summary used by Coordinators when delegating tasks.
- **Agent Color** ‚Äì color used for chat messages.
- **Managed Agents** ‚Äì for Coordinators, choose which agents they can delegate to.
- **Tool Use** ‚Äì allow the agent to call tools.
- **Enabled Tools** ‚Äì choose which tools are available when tool use is on.
- **Enable Thinking** ‚Äì if checked, the agent will generate intermediate
  thoughts before answering.
- **Thinking Steps** ‚Äì number of thinking iterations.
- **Text-to-Speech Enabled** ‚Äì speak replies aloud using the system voice.
- **Desktop History Enabled** ‚Äì capture screenshots to give the model visual context.
- **Screenshot Interval** ‚Äì seconds between captures when desktop history is on.

Press **Save** after editing to persist your changes. Use **Add New Agent** to create a new entry.
Deleting an agent permanently removes it.

## Tools Tab

Tools extend Cerebro with custom Python scripts that agents can invoke. The tab lists tools from
`tools.json` and from any plugin modules.

1. **Add Tool** ‚Äì provide a name, description and script defining `run_tool(args)`.
2. **Edit Tool** ‚Äì modify an existing tool.
3. **Delete** ‚Äì remove a tool and its script file.
4. **Run** ‚Äì execute a tool manually with JSON arguments.
   The script editor supports Python syntax highlighting when QScintilla is installed.

Bundled plugins include:
- **file-summarizer** ‚Äì create a short summary of a text file or provided text.
- **web-scraper** ‚Äì download and sanitize text from a URL.
- **math-solver** ‚Äì evaluate mathematical expressions.
- **windows-notifier** ‚Äì display a Windows 11 notification using `win10toast`.
- **notification-hub** ‚Äì cross-platform desktop alerts with optional sound and push webhooks.
- **ar-overlay** ‚Äì show a small on-screen HUD message for quick reminders.
- **desktop-automation** ‚Äì launch programs or move files through OS commands.
- **credential-manager** ‚Äì securely store and retrieve credentials via the system keyring.
- **update-manager** ‚Äì check for new versions of Cerebro and download updates on Windows 11.
- **task-sequence-recorder** ‚Äì record mouse and keyboard events and replay them later.

Agents call tools by returning a JSON block in the format produced by
`generate_tool_instructions_message()`.
When a tool is executed, the conversation view shows a üõ†Ô∏è icon with the tool
name. Expanding the entry reveals the full function call and its output. The
agent receives that result and can use it when crafting the next reply.

## Tasks Tab

Scheduled prompts appear in both a list and calendar view. Dates with tasks display a red dot and the
current day is highlighted. When there are no tasks a message labeled "No tasks available." appears below the calendar.

- **Add Task** ‚Äì create a prompt for a specific agent. The default due time is one minute from now.
- **Edit** ‚Äì change an existing task.
- **Delete** ‚Äì remove a task after confirmation.
- **Toggle Status** ‚Äì mark the selected task as completed or pending.
- **Filters** ‚Äì drop-down menus allow filtering by agent or status.
- **Row Actions** ‚Äì each task row includes Edit, Delete and Complete buttons.
- **Repeat Interval** ‚Äì optional number of minutes after which the task should repeat.
- **Time Format** ‚Äì enter times as ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` local time.

When a task‚Äôs due time arrives the associated prompt is sent automatically. Combine this feature with
the `notification-hub` tool to create desktop or push reminders. Use `desktop-automation` to act on
the `windows-notifier` tool to create desktop reminders on Windows 11. Use `desktop-automation` to act on
- **update-manager** ‚Äì check for new versions of Cerebro and download updates on Windows 11.
screenshot analysis when needed. Tasks can optionally register with
the operating system scheduler so they run even if Cerebro is not open. Windows uses Task Scheduler while
Unix-like systems use cron.

## Metrics Tab

This tab reads statistics from `metrics.json` and shows:
- **Tool Usage** ‚Äì how many times each tool has been executed.
- **Task Completions** ‚Äì number of tasks finished by each agent.
- **Average Response Times** ‚Äì mean response time of each agent in seconds.

Metrics are updated whenever agents use tools or complete tasks.

## Documentation Tab

Displays this guide within the application so you can review instructions without leaving Cerebro.

## Settings Dialog

Global preferences are available under **Settings**.
- Toggle dark mode and change your displayed user name, chat color and accent color.
- Update the Ollama runtime or pull the latest version of a model using the provided buttons.
- The list of available models is cached so opening the dialog is fast.
- Errors during updates are shown in a pop‚Äëup message.

## Configuration Files

Cerebro stores its data in several JSON files located in the application directory.

### agents.json
Defines every agent and their settings. See the fields listed in the Agents Tab section for details.
The default configuration includes a **Default Agent** enabled with all bundled tools for everyday tasks.

### tools.json
Contains tool metadata and Python code. Plugins placed in `tool_plugins` or installed with the
`cerebro_tools` entry point are loaded automatically.

### tasks.json
Holds scheduled tasks. Each entry has `id`, `creator`, `agent_name`, `prompt`, `due_time`, `status` and
`repeat_interval` fields.
Tasks are also exported to the operating system scheduler using `run_task.py` so they can fire when Cerebro is closed.

### metrics.json
Records tool usage counts, task completions and average response times.

### chat_history.json
Stores conversation history for exporting or resuming later. The file is recreated each time the
application starts unless you explicitly export the history.

## Debug Mode

Set `DEBUG_MODE=1` before launching to enable verbose logging in the console. This is useful for
diagnosing issues with tools or agent configuration.

## Developing Plugins

You can extend Cerebro by creating additional tools. Place a Python file in the `tool_plugins`
directory with a `TOOL_METADATA` dictionary and a `run_tool(args)` function. Restart Cerebro and the
new tool will appear in the Tools tab.
